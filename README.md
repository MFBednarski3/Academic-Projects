# Academic-Projects

To download these files, unzip the file and play the game from the folder in the Jar Executable. The score files must be kept in there. 

These are the Projects that I have worked on during College:

Guess My Number Game:
This game was for a project in one of my academic courses. I made the code in Java.

New 21:
A game based off of blackjack, I created a game that used some similar code to the Guess My Number game but I added it to test out how a CPU
would perform in a card game. This code was also made in Java
