# Academic-Projects

Guess My Number Game:
This game was for a project in one of my academic courses. I made the code in Java.

New 21:
A game based off of blackjack, I created a game that used some similar code to the Guess My Number game but I added it to test out how an AI
would perform in a card game. This code was also made in Java
